# Convergence-of-Chained-Equation-Algorithms
The default setting for the the number of FCS runs in mice (van Buuren &amp; Groothuis-Oudshoorn 2011) is rather low (maxit=5 ). Convergence in distribution is difficult to examine, but it is an important assumption for chained equation MI algorithms. Objectives: Conduct a simulation study to explore the effect of different missing data patterns and different quantities of interest on the convergence of the chained equations algorithm using traceplots and the Gelman-Rubin di- agnostic RË† (Gelman &amp; Rubin 1992).
